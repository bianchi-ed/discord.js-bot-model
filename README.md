The primary goal of this project is to learn and gain hands-on experience in node.js development and web development in general.

In addition, Boten Anna aims to leverage various APIs and provide features for data retrieval, Discord server management, entertainment, and more.

## Pre-Requisites

This project is currently not deployed anywhere, so creating a discord bot app will be necessary if you choose to run it. In case you are not sure how to do this, I strongly recommend reading the first step of official Discord Guide: ["Building your first Discord app"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app).

This project uses node.js in conjunction with discord.js and axios. It is possible to download node.js at: https://nodejs.org/en/download

After downloading and installing node.js be sure to run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install discord.js
```
and

```bash
$ npm install axios
```
